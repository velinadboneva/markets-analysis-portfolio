# Stocks and Portfolio Analysis Using Python - Velina Boneva

This repository contains practical financial analysis projects implemented in Python — demonstrating my skills across data acquisition, data handling, descriptive statistics, volatility intuition, and market interpretation. These projects reflect the analytical approach I bring to markets-focused roles.

## 1. Rheinmetall (RHM) Return Analysis
**Notebook:** [Analysis.ipynb](./Analysis.ipynb)

**Key components demonstrated in this notebook:**

• Importing real historical market data using the yfinance API  
• Cleaning and structuring stock data using pandas  
• Converting the Date column into a proper DateTimeIndex for time-series workflows  
• Computing daily returns and analysing their behaviour  
• Generating descriptive statistics (mean, volatility, percentiles, min/max, etc.)  
• Interpreting what the summary statistics reveal about the stock’s risk and return profile  
• Developing intuition for the questions “what happened?”, “why did it happen?”, and “what does it imply?”  

This notebook is the first step in building a broader portfolio of stock- and portfolio-analysis tools using Python. It demonstrates my ability to acquire financial data, prepare it for analysis, extract insights, and communicate them clearly and professionally.

More projects will be added as I expand this portfolio.
